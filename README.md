# Integer Linear Program Termination

Implementation of Braverman's termination algorithm
(see ["Termination of Integer Linear Programs"](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mbraverm/Papers/CAV2006.pdf) by Mark Braverman, 2006) in [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) and Python.

Example programs are found in the `examples` folder.
To check whether an example program is terminating
first install SageMath, go into the `sage`
folder and execute `sage run_example.py <example_file>`.

## Test Results ##

The test results are located in the `results` folder.
The test platform usually is a Lenovo x250 notebook with an i5-5200U cpu
running Manjaro.
